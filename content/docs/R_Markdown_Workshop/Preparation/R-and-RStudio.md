# R and Rstudio 

## Install R 

Please make sure that you have a [recent R version](https://cran.rstudio.com/) installed (>= 4.0.0 is recommended). 
You can check your R Version in the Console (in RStudio) by typing:


```R.version.string```

If you are using an older R version, please install the newest R version. 


## Install RStudio 

You may install RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). If you already have Rstudio installed, check your RStudio version like this (on a Mac):

Go to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/) and download the newest version if you are still using an older version of RStudio. Simply follow the download instructions. The new version will be available next time you open RStudio.
